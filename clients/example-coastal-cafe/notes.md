## Insights

### PREFERENCE - Owner prefers email over calls
**Date:** 2025-06-15
**Context:** Initial onboarding

Sarah (owner) is very responsive to email but hard to reach by phone during service hours. Best contact window is 9-11am before lunch prep. She reads emails during her morning coffee.

### DECISION - Playfair Display for headings, not script fonts
**Date:** 2025-06-20
**Context:** Brand design approval

Client rejected script/handwritten fonts - felt too "tourist cafe". Wanted something with more substance. Playfair Display struck the right balance of coastal elegance without being pretentious.

### TECHNICAL - Closed Tuesdays affects scheduling
**Date:** 2025-07-01
**Context:** Social media setup

Restaurant closed Tuesdays. Don't schedule posts promoting "come in today" or run ads on Tuesdays. Google Business hours already reflect this. Calendar events set to skip Tuesdays.

### PATTERN - Quarterly menu changes drive content
**Date:** 2025-09-10
**Context:** Q3 review meeting

Menu changes seasonally (Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec). Each change needs: website update, new food photography, social announcement, Google Posts update. Set reminders 2 weeks before each quarter.

### PREFERENCE - Photography must feel candid
**Date:** 2025-09-15
**Context:** Photography brief feedback

Sarah rejected staged food shots that looked "too perfect". Wants natural light, slightly imperfect compositions, real customers in background. Reference: Three Blue Ducks Instagram style.

### DECISION - No influencer partnerships
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Context:** Marketing strategy discussion

Client had bad experience with influencer who left negative review after free meal. Now policy is no comped meals for "exposure". Happy to be featured organically but won't pay or provide free meals.

### PREFERENCE - Sustainable messaging resonates
**Date:** 2026-01-15
**Context:** Q4 performance review

### CONTEXT - Fish Market relationship is key differentiator

Direct relationship with Mooloolaba Fish Market is genuine competitive advantage. Marcus (chef) goes to the wharf daily at 5am. This is authentic content gold - document and feature regularly.
